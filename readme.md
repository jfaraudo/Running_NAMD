# Material for running NAMD simulations
This repo contains supporting material for NAMD simulations:

- Some of the most common CHARMM ForceField files for use with NAMD
- Sample scripts for running MD simulations with NAMD (for equilibration and production) under different thermodynamic conditions
- Python scripts for analysis of NAMD output

For an overview about preparing NAMD simulations and instructions on how to install and run NAMD (in catalan) see:

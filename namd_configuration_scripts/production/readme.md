Generic scripts for running NAMD simulations from previously equilibrated simulations (or production continuation):

NVE: isolated system

NVT: Langevin thermostat

NpT: Langevin thermostat and barostat

NpzT: Langevin thermostat and a barostat applied only in z direction

In all cases an energy minimization is included before the MD run.

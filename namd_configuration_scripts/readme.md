Generic configuration scripts for running NAMD simulations:

- Energy minimization (geometry optimization) needed before any MD run.
- Equilibration (from energy minimized structures) in NVE, NVT or NpT ensembles
- Production (from Equilibrated simulations) in NVE, NVT or NpT ensembles

See NAMD3 User Guide for details:

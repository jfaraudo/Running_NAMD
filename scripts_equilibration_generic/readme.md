Generic scripts for equilibrating NAMD simulations in different ensembles:

NVE: isolated system

NVT: Langevin thermostat

NpT: Langevin thermostat and barostat

NpzT: Langevin thermostat and a barostat applied only in z direction


In all cases an energy minimization is included before the MD run.

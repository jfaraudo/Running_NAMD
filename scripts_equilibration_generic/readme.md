Generic scripts for equilibrating NAMD simulations in different thermostats:

NVE: isolated system \n
NVT: Langevin thermostat \n
NpT: Langevin thermostat and barostat \n
NpzT: Langevin thermostat and a barostat applied only in z direction \n

In all cases an energy minimization is included before the MD run
